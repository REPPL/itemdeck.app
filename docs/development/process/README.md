# Process

Development process documentation - how work was done.

## Contents

- [devlogs/](./devlogs/) - Development narratives per milestone
- [retrospectives/](./retrospectives/) - Post-milestone reflections
- [time-logs/](./time-logs/) - Time tracking entries

## Purpose

This directory captures:
- **How** we built each feature (devlogs)
- **What we learned** after milestones (retrospectives)
- **How long** work took (time-logs)

## Workflow

### During Development
1. Track time in `time-logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. Note challenges and decisions

### After Milestone Completion
1. Create devlog: `devlogs/v0.X.0/README.md`
2. Create retrospective: `retrospectives/v0.X.0/README.md`
3. Summarise time spent
