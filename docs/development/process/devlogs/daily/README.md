# Daily Development Logs

Optional daily progress logs for detailed session tracking.

## Purpose

Daily logs capture granular development progress that may be too detailed for milestone devlogs. Use these for:

- Session-by-session progress tracking
- Debugging notes and discoveries
- Quick decisions that don't warrant an ADR
- Personal development notes

## File Naming

Use ISO date format: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Example: `2025-01-15.md`

## Template

```markdown
# Daily Log: YYYY-MM-DD

## Session Goals

- [ ] Goal 1
- [ ] Goal 2

## Progress

### Morning Session

- What was accomplished
- Decisions made
- Blockers encountered

### Afternoon Session

- Continued work
- Issues resolved

## Notes

Any additional observations or learnings.

## Tomorrow

- Planned next steps
```

## When to Use

- **Use daily logs** for detailed session tracking during active development
- **Skip daily logs** if milestone devlogs provide sufficient detail
- **Optional** - not required for milestone completion
