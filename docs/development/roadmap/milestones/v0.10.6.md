# v0.10.6 - Documentation Sync & Forgotten Features

## Overview

Documentation-only release that recognises six features which were implemented during earlier development cycles but never moved from "planned" to "completed" status in the documentation.

**Theme:** Documentation Sync & Forgotten Features
**Type:** Documentation-only (no code changes)

## Features Recognised

| ID | Feature | Component Path | Originally Planned |
|----|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| F-014 | Virtual Scrolling | `src/components/VirtualCardGrid/` | v0.4.0 |
| F-015 | Image Lazy Loading | `src/components/LazyImage/` | v0.4.0 |
| F-028 | Card Drag and Drop | `src/components/DraggableCardGrid/` | v0.4.0 |
| F-032 | Card Stack View | `src/components/CardStack/` | v0.4.0 |
| F-035 | Card Quick Actions | `src/components/CardQuickActions/` | v0.4.0 |
| F-038 | Card Carousel Mode | `src/components/CardCarousel/` | v0.4.0 |

## Discovery Context

During a comprehensive codebase audit comparing documentation against implementation, these six features were found to have:

1. **Working implementations** - All components exist in `src/components/`
2. **Complete functionality** - Each feature is functional and integrated
3. **Stale documentation** - Feature specs still in `features/planned/`

## Documentation Changes

### Files Moved

```
features/planned/ → features/completed/
├── F-014-virtual-scrolling.md
├── F-015-image-lazy-loading.md
├── F-028-card-drag-and-drop.md
├── F-032-card-stack-view.md
├── F-035-card-quick-actions.md
└── F-038-card-carousel-mode.md
```

### Index Updates

- `roadmap/README.md` - Added v0.10.1, v0.10.5, v0.10.6 milestones; updated feature statuses
- `milestones/README.md` - Added v0.10.6 to timeline
- `features/README.md` - Created v0.10.6 section with recognised features

## Dependencies

- **v0.10.5**: Field Descriptions & Demo Data (prerequisite)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Documentation drift accumulates** - Without regular sync checks, implemented features can go undocumented
2. **Audit value** - Periodic comprehensive audits catch gaps that incremental reviews miss
3. **Automation opportunity** - Consider CI checks to detect planned features with matching component directories

## Release Preparation

- [x] All feature files moved to completed/
- [x] Feature files updated with implementation notes
- [x] Roadmap indexes updated
- [x] Milestone document created
- [x] Devlog created
- [x] Retrospective written
