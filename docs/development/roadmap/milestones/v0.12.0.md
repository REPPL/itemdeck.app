## Mechanics Overview

### Memory Game
Classic card matching game. Flip cards to find pairs, track score and attempts.

### Collection
Track owned items and wishlist. Mark cards as owned, add to wishlist, view progress.

### Snap Ranking
Viral tier-list creation. Rate cards one at a time without seeing what's next, generate shareable results.

## Key Implementation Notes

### Gaming Mechanics

1. **Memory**: Full game loop with animations, flip states, match detection
2. **Collection**: Persistent tracking with progress bar and export
3. **Snap Ranking**: Focused UX emphasising spontaneity and shareability

### Deferred Features

4. **Card Sorting**: Multiple sort options (name, date, platform, custom)
5. **Statistics Dashboard**: CSS-only charts enhancing existing F-062

### Collection Loading

6. **Entity Auto-Discovery**: Fallback pattern for loading entities without `index.json` via GitHub API directory listing

### Bug Fixes

7. **Card Back Logo**: Fix app logo and platform logo display - investigate fallback chain in Card.tsx and CardBack.tsx
8. **Drag Handle Overlay**: Keep draggable area attached to card during drag operation
9. **Cache Notification**: Show collection name when caching (e.g., "Caching Retro Games...")

### Enhancements

10. **Selection Count Default**: Implement smart default calculation - 50% of available cards, minimum 8 if deck has more than 8 cards, otherwise the total deck size
