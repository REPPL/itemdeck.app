| F-111 | Overlay Consistency | ✅ Complete | To Update |
| F-112 | Example Loading | ⚠️ Verify | To Update |
| F-113 | Lazy Loading Indicator | ⚠️ Verify | To Update |
| F-114 | Update Checking | ✅ Complete | To Update |
| F-115 | Caching Transparency | ✅ Complete | To Update |

## Implementation Tracks

Work can proceed in parallel across these tracks:

| Track | Focus | Features | Est. Hours |
|-------|-------|----------|------------|
| **A** | Documentation | Sync roadmap, move features | 4-6 |
| **B** | Settings UX | F-116, F-117 | 24-32 |
| **C** | Mechanics UX | F-118, mechanic consistency | 12-16 |
| **D** | Multi-Collection | F-064, comparison mechanic | 24-32 |
| **E** | Hardening | Performance, accessibility, docs | 8-12 |
| **F** | Caching Review | F-120, cache system audit | 8-12 |
| **G** | Display Options | F-037, Sort/Group By fix | 4-8 |

**Total Estimated Effort: 86-122 hours**

## Dependencies

### Required Before v1.0.0

- **v0.15.5**: Infrastructure & Documentation (✅ Complete)
- **v0.15.0**: User Experience & Polish (⚠️ Code complete, docs outdated)

## Key Implementation Notes

### F-064: Collection Comparison (as Mechanic)

Implement comparison as a mechanic rather than core navigation:
- Reuses existing mechanic infrastructure
- Accessed via Mechanics menu / Play settings tab
- Clean activation/deactivation lifecycle
- Display preferences for split view

See [F-064 Specification](../features/planned/F-064-collection-comparison.md) for full details.

### F-116: Settings Reorganisation

```
Current: Quick | Appearance | Collections | Data | System
    ↓
New:     Display | Collection | Play | System
```

The new "Play" tab centralises all mechanic settings and provides the entry point for game mechanics.

### F-037: Card Sorting Review

The v0.15.5 ViewPopover has a Sort/Group By interaction bug:
- Selecting "By Rank" + "Year" group displays cards sorted by year, ignoring rank
- Need to fix the interaction logic so sorting works within groups

Additionally, review invalid option combinations:
- Should Sort options change when a Group By is selected?
- Should some combinations be disabled or hidden entirely?
- Reference R-017 research for UX guidance

### F-118: Mechanics UX Standards

All mechanics MUST:
1. Have exit button in top-left position
2. Support Escape key to exit
3. Declare requirements in manifest
4. Show requirements in Play tab before activation
5. Have accessible help/instructions

## Research

- [R-008: Fuzzy Matching](../../research/R-008-fuzzy-matching.md) - For F-064 comparison
- [R-010: Visual Consistency](../../research/state-of-the-art-visual-consistency.md) - For F-116/F-117
- [R-017: Disabled vs Hidden Options](../../research/R-017-disabled-vs-hidden-options.md) - For F-037, ViewPopover UX
- [Card UI Design Patterns](../../research/card-ui-design-patterns.md) - For F-041, F-064, F-119

## v1.5.0 Preparation

v1.0.0 lays groundwork for the plugin ecosystem:

| Preparation | How |
|-------------|-----|
| Mechanic interface validated | F-064 is most complex mechanic |
| Export formats established | F-081/F-082 complete |
| Requirements system | F-118 adds manifest requirements |
| Settings architecture | F-116 creates extensible structure |
