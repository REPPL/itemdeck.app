## Explanations

**Location:** `docs/explanation/`

### 1. mechanics-system.md

**Purpose:** Conceptual overview of game mechanics

**Content Outline:**
```markdown
# The Mechanics System

Understand how game mechanics work in itemdeck.

## What are Mechanics?
Mechanics are interactive game modes that transform your card collection into playable experiences. Instead of just browsing cards, you can:
- Play memory matching games
- Create tier rankings
- Quiz yourself on card knowledge
- Compete against AI opponents

## How Mechanics Work
1. **Selection** - Choose a mechanic from the Games menu
2. **Configuration** - Set options like card count
3. **Activation** - The mechanic takes control of the display
4. **Interaction** - Play according to the mechanic's rules
5. **Completion** - See results and statistics

## Built-in Mechanics

### Memory Match
Classic card matching game...

### Snap Ranking
Instant tier-list creation...

## Mechanic Requirements
Each mechanic has requirements:
- Minimum card count
- Required fields (e.g., numeric values)
- Player count

## Adding More Mechanics
Install mechanic plugins to add new games...

**Content Outline:**
```markdown
# Plugin Architecture

How itemdeck's extensibility system works.

## Overview
itemdeck uses a plugin architecture that allows:
- Custom themes
- New game mechanics
- Additional data sources
- Extended settings

## Plugin Types

### Themes
Control the visual appearance...

### Mechanics
Add new game modes...

### Sources
Connect to different data providers...

## Distribution Tiers

### Built-in
Plugins bundled with itemdeck. Always available, fully trusted.

### Official
Reviewed plugins from the itemdeck registry. Verified safe.

### Community
User-created plugins loaded by URL. Run in a security sandbox.

## Security Model
Community plugins run in isolation:
- Cannot access your data without permission
- Limited capabilities by default
- Must request permission for sensitive actions

## Plugin Lifecycle
1. Discovery - Find plugins in registry or by URL
2. Installation - Download and validate
3. Activation - Enable and initialise
4. Usage - Plugin features become available
5. Updates - Check for and apply updates

### 3. data-sources.md

**Purpose:** Explain collection data sources

**Content Outline:**
```markdown
# Data Sources

How itemdeck loads and manages collection data.

## What is a Data Source?
A data source is a connection to a location where card collections are stored. The default source is GitHub.

## GitHub Source
itemdeck loads collections from public GitHub repositories.

### How It Works
1. You provide a GitHub username and collection path
2. itemdeck fetches the collection.json and cards.json files
3. Card images are loaded from the repository or external URLs
4. Data is cached locally for offline use

### URL Formats
Multiple URL formats are supported...

## Collection Structure
Collections follow a standard structure...

## Caching
Collections are cached in your browser:
- Metadata cached for 7 days
- Images cached indefinitely
- Clear cache in Settings

## Future Sources
The plugin system enables additional sources:
- Local files
- Other hosting services
- Custom APIs
