# Playing the Memory Game

Learn how to play the Memory matching game with your card collection.

## What You'll Learn

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

- Start a Memory game with your collection
- Configure game options
- Play the game effectively
- Track your score and progress

## Prerequisites

- A loaded collection with at least 4 cards
- Basic familiarity with the itemdeck interface (see [Getting Started](getting-started.md))

## Starting a Memory Game

### Step 1: Open the Navigation Hub

Look for the floating buttons in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Click the game controller icon to access the Mechanics menu.

Alternatively, you can access mechanics through Settings > Mechanics.

### Step 2: Select Memory Game

From the mechanics list, click "Memory Game". You'll see a brief description:

> Match pairs of cards by flipping them to reveal their faces

### Step 3: Configure Game Options

Before starting, you can adjust the following settings:

| Setting | Options | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Difficulty | Easy, Medium, Hard | Affects number of pairs and time pressure |
| Pair Count | 4-12 pairs | Number of card pairs to match |

Once configured, the game begins automatically when you activate the mechanic.

## How to Play

### Flipping Cards

Click or tap any face-down card to flip it and reveal its front face. The card remains flipped for a few seconds, giving you time to find its match.

**Keyboard shortcut**: Use arrow keys to navigate between cards, then press `Space` or `Enter` to flip.

### Making Matches

1. Flip the first card to reveal it
2. Flip a second card to compare
3. If both cards match, they stay face-up
4. If they don't match, both cards flip back face-down

The goal is to remember card positions and match all pairs with the fewest moves.

### Score and Progress

The game tracks:

- **Moves**: Total number of card flips
- **Matches**: Pairs successfully matched
- **Time**: Elapsed time since game start

A progress indicator shows how many pairs you've matched out of the total.

## Completing a Game

When you've matched all pairs, the game ends and displays your final score. You can:

- **Play Again**: Reset the game with the same settings
- **Exit**: Return to normal viewing mode

To exit at any time, press `Escape` or click the close button on the game overlay.

## Tips for Success

1. **Focus on corners**: Start with corner cards as reference points
2. **Create mental groups**: Associate cards by visual similarity
3. **Work systematically**: Clear one area before moving to another
4. **Watch the timer**: If using timed mode, balance speed with accuracy
5. **Use keyboard navigation**: Arrow keys can be faster than clicking

## Difficulty Levels

| Level | Pairs | Strategy |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Easy | 4-6 | Ideal for learning, small grid |
| Medium | 6-9 | Balanced challenge |
| Hard | 9-12 | Tests memory capacity |
